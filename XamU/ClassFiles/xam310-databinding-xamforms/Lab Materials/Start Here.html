        <h2>Before you begin</h2>
        <p>
        This is a Xamarin.Forms class which includes projects for iOS, Android, and Windows. 
        When working on the exercises, you can select the easiest supported platform to run your application on. Refer to the <a href="https://university.xamarin.com/resources/setup-requirements" target="_blank">Setup Requirements</a> on the Xamarin University website if you need help with your development environment.
        </p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
        This session introduces the data binding infrastructure that is built into Xamarin.Forms. You will learn how to take advantage of this feature in your Xamarin.Forms applications to reduce the amount of code necessary to present data in your screens.
        </p>

        <h2>Objectives</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Introduction to Data Binding</li>
            <li>Dealing with Incompatible Types</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Exercises</h2>
        <p>
           The lab exercises utilize image resources for various characters from the Simpsons TV series and were obtained with permission from <a href="http://www.simpsoncrazy.com/pictures">simpsoncrazy.com</a>.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <div class="objective">Using Data Binding in a Xamarin.Forms Application</div>
                <a href="./parts/part1.html">Exercise</a>
                <br />
                This group exercise will introduce creating and using bindings in code-behind and XAML.
            </li>

            <li>
                <div class="objective">Working with Two-Way Bindings</div>
                <a href="./parts/part2.html">Exercise</a>
                <br />
                This exercise will implement two-way binding for our UI and ensure the UI is updated when the underlying data is changed by implementing the <code>INotifyPropertyChanged</code> interface.
            </li>

            <li>
               <div class="objective">Using Value Converters</div>
                <a href="./parts/part3.html">Exercise</a>
                <br />
                There isn't always a 1:1 mapping between our available data and the user interface that presents that data. Value Converters are the bridge which spans this difference. In this exercise, we will continue editing our contacts application and add support to data bind images to our resources.
