    <section id="main">

        <h1 id="page-title"></h1>

        <h2>Duration</h2>
        <p>10 minutes</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>
            In this lab exercise, you will complete your offline caching by providing the code that synchronizes the local DB to the remote DB on Azure.
        </p>

        <h2>Assets</h2>
        <p>
            There is a completed version of the exercise in the <b>Part 05 Resources</b> folder. You should continue from your current work, or use the completed version in the prior lab folder as a starting point.
        </p>

        <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p>
        There are several steps we will take for this lab. You can explore on your own to implement the functionality for your service, or use the step-by-step instructions below.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Push any changes to the remote DB when the app is launched.</li>
            <li>Pull down the latest <b>questions</b> table when the app is launched.</li>
            <li>Synchronize changes to the <b>responses</b> table each time we change the question or the name.</li>
            <li>Finally, optimize our code by detecting the network state with the <b>Xam.Plugin.Connectivity</b> NuGet package.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Validating the offline synchronization</h2>
        <p>
        Since you'll now be working offline, it's helpful to be able to look at what's currently on the server. You can do this by hitting the <b>responses</b> table directly with a REST client such as <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/">Postman</a>. The endpoint you want is <a href="https://xamu-voter.azurewebsites.net/tables/responses/">https://xamu-voter.azurewebsites.net/tables/responses/</a>. Alternatively, you can use the following code in <a href="https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/workbooks/">Xamarin Workbooks</a> or paste it into a Console application or some other C# IDE and run it.
        </p>

string AzureUrl = "https://xamu-voter.azurewebsites.net/tables/responses/";

    .ToString(Formatting.Indented));

        <!-- Steps -->
        <h1>Steps</h1>

        <h2>Synchronize the Questions table</h2>
        <p>
        Let's start by synchronizing the <b>questions</b> table. We'll do this as part of our initialization logic in our service code.
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>
            Locate the <code>InitializeAsync</code> method and use the <code>MobileServiceClient.SyncContext</code> to push changes to the remote DB after we initialize our sync tables.
            </li>
            <li>
            After you've pushed changes which may have been made while offline, go ahead and pull all questions down. Since these don't change frequently, we'll just pull them down once as part of our initialization code.
                <ul class="indent-none">
                    <li>Since this is part of our initialization code, go ahead and pass in a query name (such as "allQuestions") so we turn on incremental sync.</li>
                    <li>You can use a standard full query.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
            Make sure to catch exceptions, for now just dump the exception to the debug console using <code class="prettyprint">Debug.WriteLine</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
            Run the app and verify that you get questions in the UI now.
            </li>
        </ol>

<p><a href="#" onclick="toggleCode(this,'sync_questions');return false;" class="uiitem">Show Code</a><div class="indent-medium" id="sync_questions" style="display:none;">
<pre class="prettyprint">
async Task InitializeAsync()
{
    if (client != null)
        return;

    ...

    try
    {
        <mark>await client.SyncContext.PushAsync ();
        await questionsTable.PullAsync (
            "allQuestions", questionsTable.CreateQuery ());</mark>
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        Debug.WriteLine ("Got exception: {0}", ex.Message);
    }
}
</pre></div></p>

        <h2>Synchronize the response table</h2>
        <p>
        Next, we need to write a method to synchronize our response table. Since this table will be changed by our app (and on the server), we will need to synchronize it more often than the questions. Since the app always works with responses only for the current question, we'll use a custom query that only synchronizes for a specific question.
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Add a new method named <b>SynchronizeResponsesAsync</b> that returns a <code>Task</code> and takes a <code>string</code> which is the <b>questionId</b> we want to retrieve responses for.</li>
            <li>Use the <code>PullAsync</code> method to retrieve just the responses for the passed <b>questionId</b>.
                <ul class="indent-none">
                    <li>We can turn on incremental sync by supplying a query name, however it needs to be <em>unique</em> for each query - meaning it needs to take into account the <b>questionId</b>. The easiest way to do that is to generate a unique string by appending the questionId itself.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>As with the previous code, make sure to catch exceptions; just output them to the debug console.</li>
        </ol>

async Task SynchronizeResponsesAsync(string questionId)

                                          r => r.SurveyQuestionId == questionId));

    } catch (Exception ex) {
        // TODO: handle error
        Debug.WriteLine ("Got exception: {0}", ex.Message);
    }
}
</pre></div></p> 
        <ol start="4">
            <li>
            We will want to perform the response synchronization each time we change a record - so add a call to our new <code>SynchronizeResponsesAsync</code> method into your <code>AddOrUpdateSurveyResponseAsync</code> and <code>DeleteSurveyResponseAsync</code> methods after you make the change.
            </li>
        </ol>

public async Task AddOrUpdateSurveyResponseAsync (SurveyResponse response)
{
    await InitializeAsync ();
    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(response.Id)) {
        await responseTable.InsertAsync (response);
    }

    await responseTable.UpdateAsync (response);
    <mark>await SynchronizeResponsesAsync (response.SurveyQuestionId);</mark>
}

public async Task DeleteSurveyResponseAsync (SurveyResponse response)
{
    await InitializeAsync ();
    await responseTable.DeleteAsync(response);

        <ol start="5">
            <li>
            We also want to synchronize to the response table when we change the current question or the name - in both cases, this will call our <code>GetResponseForSurveyAsync</code> method. However, we don't want to refresh against the table every single time since this is called quite often. Instead, let's only refresh if the passed questionId parameter changes.
            <ul class="indent-none">
                <li>Create a private field in the class to hold the last known questionId we refreshed our responses for.</li>
                <li>Check the field against the passed <b>questionId</b> parameter. If it's different, then synchronize against the responses table using our method and set the last question id field.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
            Run the application and try adding and deleting a few records and compare it to the online version through the Workbook or a REST client.
            </li>
        </ol>

string lastQuestionId;

public async Task&lt;SurveyResponse> GetResponseForSurveyAsync (
    string questionId, string name)
{
    await InitializeAsync ();

    <mark>if (lastQuestionId != questionId) {
        // Get the latest responses for this question.
        await SynchronizeResponsesAsync (questionId);
        lastQuestionId = questionId;

    return (await responseTable.Where (

            .ToEnumerableAsync ()).FirstOrDefault ();
}
</pre></div></p> 
        
        <h2>Work with the application offline</h2>
        <p>
            Next, let's force the app offline and see how it responds. Prior to our changes, it would have simply failed. We have several ways we can test no network - if you are on a physical device, you can switch to Airplane mode, on a simulator it's a bit harder. On iOS, you can use the <a href="http://nshipster.com/network-link-conditioner/">Network Link Conditioner</a>. Alternatively we can take the easy way out and just change the <b>AzureUrl</b> value to be something we cannot resolve.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Change the AzureUrl constant string to be invalid. For example, change the ".net" suffix to ".zzz" (kind of like it's sleeping!)</li>
            <li>
            <li>
            Run the application and make some changes. Check the live server - you should not see your changes.
            </li>
            <li>
            Shutdown the app, reset the URL back and run it again. When it launches, verify your changes are still in the app by looking at all responses; it should immediately synchronize back to the server.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Optimize the network code (Optional)</h2>
        <p>
            As a last step, let's optimize our network code slightly by checking to see if we have network connectivity before attempting to synchronize to the database.
        </p>        
        <ol>
            <li>Add a NuGet reference to <b>Xam.Plugin.Connectivity</b> to all your projects.</li>
            <img class="indent-none" src="./res/images/ex5-connectivity.png" />
            <li>Check the <code class="prettyprint">Plugin.Connectivity.CrossConnectivity.Current.IsConnected</code> property before attempting to synchronize to the remote DB.</li>
            <li>Run the application to verify that it all still works properly.</li>
            <li>The completed solution has this code in place.</li>
        </ol>

        <h1>Summary</h1>
        <p>
            In this exercise, you added full support for locally caching data using the built-in support and broke your app! We'll fix it next.
